Robot-Code-2014
===============

The Fighting Calculators' code for the 2014 game, Aerial Assist.

###How to Get Started
1. Download and install [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/). Have an account and have an Owner add you to the group. Follow the setup in the app.
2. Clone the Robot-Code-2014 repository to a directory without spaces in the name (that's WindRiver being picky).
3. Make sure all WindRiver updates are installed. Open "WindRiver Workbench" and use the default workspace. Nothing important is going into the workspace. Do not use the code repository as your workspace.
4. Go to File > Import. Expand "General". Click "Existing files into workspace". Click next.
5. "Select root directory": Click browse and navigate to the directory in which you cloned the robot code. Don't select "Robot-Code-2014", select "GitHub".
6. Make sure "copy projects into workspace" is unchecked. This is a very important step and checking it would result in not being able to sync any of the code you've edited.
7. Click finish. You should now be able to edit the code freely. Once saved, go back into the GitHub program and commit your most recent changes.

If any step along the way fails or you get confused, **Please** contact Ben, Charter, Max, or anyone else who has done this before.
